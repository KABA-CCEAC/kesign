                    In 2011 kaba ag started a project called __WIMP__ focused on defining a styleguide 
                    for software - like it was defined for hardware devices before. The result 
                    was a nice modern visual style focusing on web applications.

                    __kesign__ should fill some gaps from the WIMP project by bringing a more interactive form of 
                    the styleguide document. Additional it should provide all 
                    what is needed to build a webapplication in the __offical kaba softwaredesign styleguide__. 
                    So you could focus on developing the solutions and just adopt the provided styles.
